Description: multi-language source code analyzer
 doxyparse builts on doxygen's great source code parsing infrastructure and
 provides a command-line tool that can be used to obtain informatin from source
 code, such as:
 .
  * which functions/methods and variables/attributes a module/class contains
  * which functions/methods calls/uses which functions/methods/variables
  * etc
 .
 doxyparses's main goal is to be used by higher-level source code analyzis
 tools.
